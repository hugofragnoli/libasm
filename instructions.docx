Chapter III
Mandatory part
• The library must be called libasm.a.
• You must submit a main function that will test your functions and compile with
your library to demonstrate that it is functional.
• You must rewrite the following functions in assembly:
◦ ft_strlen (man 3 strlen)
◦ ft_strcpy (man 3 strcpy)
◦ ft_strcmp (man 3 strcmp)
◦ ft_write (man 2 write)
◦ ft_read (man 2 read)
◦ ft_strdup (man 3 strdup, you can call to malloc)
• You must check for errors during syscalls and handle them properly when needed.
• Your code must set the variable errno properly.
• For that, you are allowed to call the extern ___error or errno_location

Bonus part
You can rewrite these functions in assembly. The linked list functions will use the follow-
ing structure:
typedef struct s_list
{
void *data;
struct s_list *next;
} t_list;
• ft_atoi_base (see Annex V.1)
• ft_list_push_front (see Annex V.2)
• ft_list_size (see Annex V.3)
• ft_list_sort (see Annex V.4)
• ft_list_remove_if (see Annex V.5)
